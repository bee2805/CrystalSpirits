<!-- FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY-->
<!-- You can add the links to all of your imagery at the bottom of the file as references -->
## Features and Functionality

### Splash Screen

I implemented a splash screen that displays as soon as the application is opened by the user. It is active for 3 seconds and thereafter the user will be directed to the onboarding screens.

### Onboarding Screens

The onboarding screens have brief information about the application that give the user an understanding of what it may be about. The onboarding screens only display when the user opens the app for the first time. I was able to do this utilizing App storage.

### Crystals List/Home Screen & Detailed Crystal View

The Home page has a list of different crystals as well as a search bar that allows to user to find the crystal they are looking for.

<br/>
The result screen displays after a user have completed a category. The score from the specific Category played is displayed here.
