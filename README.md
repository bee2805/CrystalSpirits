<!-- FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY-->
<!-- You can add the links to all of your imagery at the bottom of the file as references -->
## Features and Functionality

### Splash Screen

I implemented a splash screen that displays as soon as the application is opened by the user. It is active for 3 seconds and thereafter the user will be directed to the onboarding screens.

### Onboarding Screens

The onboarding screens have brief information about the application that give the user an understanding of what it may be about. The onboarding screens only display when the user opens the app for the first time. I was able to do this utilizing App storage.

### Crystals List/Home Screen & Detailed Crystal View

The Home page has a list of different crystals as well as a search bar that allows to user to find the crystal they are looking for.
<br/>
The result screen displays after a user have completed a category. The score from the specific Category played is displayed here.

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->

### Wireframes

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* It was super exciting to learn Kotlin and build my very first android app!
* Ater getting my muse, which was OK Boomer, the excitement grew each day. I had a lot of fun doing the research, especially for the lyric-based questions. 
* I had a lot of fun doing the research, especially for the lyric-based questions. 

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* Because of the way I set up my questions, I had challenges when trying to navigate to the next question activity in a specific genre.
* I struggled to set the session storage for the scores from each category from the results activity.


#### Above And Beyond

* I implemented different ways in which a question can be answered - Either a text input with appropriate validation or selecting between three answers.
* 8 questions per category instead of 5
* 5 categories instead of 3

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* I'd like to implement the high scores from each category.
* Visual communication when the incorrect or correct answer is chosen
* A light and dark mode toggle in the settings menu

<!-- MOCKUPS -->
